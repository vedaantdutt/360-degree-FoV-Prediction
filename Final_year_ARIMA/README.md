## Requirements
Use `python3` for all the codes. Install the dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  

After the installation, source code for the package `creme` needs to be modified. For the same, go to the location(say, `PATH`) in your system where `creme` library source codes are stored(eg, `~/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/creme/`) and copy the file `creme/linear_model/pa.py` into the appropriate subdirectory in `PATH`. 


## Datasets
In our experiments, we have particularly used two popular datasets containing several 360-degree videos of different categories along with head tracking log. 

1. Xavier Corbillon, Francesca De Simone, and Gwendal Simon. [2017]. *360-Degree Video Head Movement Dataset.* In Proceedings of the ACM MMSys 2017. 
It includes five videos freely viewed by 59 users each with each video watched for 70 seconds. The dataset is available from [http://dash.ipv6.enstb.fr/headMovements/](http://dash.ipv6.enstb.fr/headMovements/)
2. Chenglei Wu, Zhihao Tan, Zhi Wang, and Shiqiang Yang. [2017]. *A Dataset for Exploring User Behaviors in VR Spherical Video Streaming.* In Proceedings of the ACM MMSys 2017. 
It has nine popular videos watched by 48 users with an average view duration of 164 seconds. The dataset is available from [https://wuchlei-thu.github.io/](https://wuchlei-thu.github.io/)


## Pipeline
	Install Requirements and modify the source code (creme/)
					|
	Preprocess the video and store the object trajectories (Preprocess/)
					|
	Transform the quaternion format of the Head Movement Logs to Equirectangular form (PanoSaliency/)
					|
	Run PARIMA and calculate the QoE of a video (Prediction/)

**Note:** Follow the `README.md` inside each of the directories to get the details of the execution.
